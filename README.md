# Vulnerability-to-Climate-Disasters


## I. Purpose of the Research

:small_orange_diamond: To predict the number of deaths and injuries caused by extreme weather events <br>
:small_orange_diamond: To identify the most vulnerable communities that are at higher risk of losing lives due to climate disasters 


## II. Scope of Research

:triangular_flag_on_post: The U.S. context, at the *county-level* <br>
:triangular_flag_on_post: Climate-related deaths and injuries that have occurred throughout **2016-2020**

## III. Machine Learning Model

:small_orange_diamond: LASSO regression <br>
:small_orange_diamond: Random forest regression

:writing_hand: The *non-parametric* technique (Random Forest) performed better in terms of predicting the number of casualty. <br> However, all in all, both techniques *failed to account for the complexity of climate-related health outcomes*

:writing_hand: Contrary to expectations, *wealthy communities were exposed to higher risk of natural disasters* than their socioeconomically disadvantaged counterparts, which led to greater number of casualty in such communities

:writing_hand: *Access to emergency wards* and the size of the population living in *group quarters* as well as that of the *aging population* were the most important predictors of climate-induced deaths and injuries 

:writing_hand: There was inconclusive evidence to conclude that counties with a larger African American
population or Hispanic/Latinos were more at risk than others, but counties with a larger Asian population tended to be the least affected by deaths and injuries from climate events


## VI. Implications

👉 Emphasis on targeting at-risk communities that may not conform to the *conventional* notions of 'vulnerability'

👉 Prioritization of the following communities when it comes to disaster risk management: <br>
:small_orange_diamond: counties with *limited access to emergency health care* <br>
:small_orange_diamond: counties with a higher percentage of the *elderly population* <br>
:small_orange_diamond: counties with a larger share of the population that live in non-standard forms of *group housing*

👉 The limitations of CDC's Social Vulnerability Index <br>
:small_orange_diamond: The importance of *proximity to health care*, in accounting for the size of climate-related casualty <br>
:small_orange_diamond: The importance of *distinguishing between racial and ethnic minority groups*, to account for the disproportionate impacts of climate disasters
